# TO PERU
- October: the weather is good for machu pichu and is the season for whale watching. It is however not the best time for the coast (cold / misty) and by the time we reach Pantanal and Bonito (nov/Dec) it may be too rainy/flooded. However, if we see we dont want to reach the forest at this weather, we could go to Brazil and explore the south, like florianopolis or iguazu. (one can fly to buenos aires or assuncion from Santa cruz de la sierra) and then move to these other places.

- good point from starting from Peru: cheap spanish course, no worry about flights.

- Fligth on Monday: 500 CHF 

# TO ECUADOR
- To make sure we have "enough" to see, we could also start from ecuador and only go to safe places. It seems to be in general safer than colombia and mexico: https://www.statista.com/statistics/947781/homicide-rates-latin-america-caribbean-country/. Guayaquil and the north should be avoided, but maybe we can still check a few other places? https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ecuador-travel-advisory.html

- For instance, Puerto lopez (surrounded by the machalilla national park) seem to be very safe, perfect for humpback whale watching from June to October and for diving (for instance taking a tour to isla de la plata)

    - other stuff in ecuador before /after puerto lopez: banos, cuenca, vilcabamba, mindo, quilotoa lake, cotopaxi, canoa, and the shoreline (salinas, montanitas, etc) [travel blog](https://velvetescape.com/ten-places-you-should-not-miss-in-ecuador/)

- From Cuenca (or Vilcabamba), it seems to be easy to get to Peru (for instance Piura)

- it is possible to rent a car in quito and return it in Cuenca for instance. Alternatively, returning in Guayaquil or back in quito and then flying to lima (130-250 CHF, depending on how last minute) is also possible

    - 550-600 from Zurich

# "Directly" to galapagos and then Lima: Zurich -> Galapagos, galapagos -> Lima
- advantage: safe, and galapagos seem to be the only place one can swim with sea lions 
- MUCH more expensive and quite a few additional flights
- Dec to Feb is more recommended because it is warmer (and marine life is more active), but Oct-Nov is dry and one can see whales 

# From costa rica:
- we have to think about which flights to book or rather start from mexiko, like cancun. But he problem of starting from there is that we would have to cross honduras or san salvador, which seem to be more dangerous than ecuador
- it is not the best time (best time is in between dec and april, October is the month it rains the most there) time around christmas break is the busiest there. 
- Spanish course expensive
- Direct flight from frankfurt to Cancun: 500 CHF
- Zurique Cancun: 490

# punta cana 
- (dominican republic): hurricane season from aug to late october.
- with swiss from Fra: 440

# starting from brazil
- it is hard to find a place where we both have to be in order to go back to washington and zurich. 
- we would miss Christmas / news eve. Prefer to be in a "safe place" just before starting working
- Zurich rio (14.10): 480 CHF
