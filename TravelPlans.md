- by the time we reach Pantanal and Bonito (nov/Dec) it may be too rainy/flooded. However, if we see we dont want to reach the forest at this weather, we could go to Brazil and explore the south, like florianopolis or iguazu. (one can fly to buenos aires or assuncion from Santa cruz de la sierra) and then move to these other places.
