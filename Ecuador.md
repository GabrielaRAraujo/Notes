    - other stuff in ecuador before /after puerto lopez: banos, cuenca, vilcabamba, mindo, quilotoa lake, cotopaxi, canoa, and the shoreline (salinas, montanitas, etc) [travel blog](https://velvetescape.com/ten-places-you-should-not-miss-in-ecuador/)

## ToDo's: 
- 

## Puerto Lopez
- we are taking the [diving course](https://www.maresecuador.com/diving-safaris) here

It is surrounded by the machalilla national park. It seems to be very safe, perfect for humpback whale watching from June to October and for diving (for instance taking a tour to isla de la plata)
- A few things to do:
    - [whale watching ecuador](https://www.voyagers.travel/blog/best-places-to-see-whales-ecuador)
    - [whale watching tour + schnorchel w. biologist](https://whalewatchingecuador.com/de/activity/70747/full-day-with-whales-ecuador-puerto-lopez)

## Galapagos 

- 3 main islands 
- I would not stay longer than 10 above-water days on Galapagos, it got a little bit boring at the end I would say. 1 or 1.5 weeks is a good amount of time if you visit all 3 main islands imo. They are not too different so you could stay shorter and only visit 2 as well.
- Scuba diving: if you go scuba diving there you should do a course somewhere else before to already get some experience and save a lot of money. Scuba diving in Galapagos can be a bit tricky because of underwater currents at some locations (but not all!). It is really doable however. My girlfriend did her first scuba diving course there and enjoyed it a lot. You should not dive from San Cristobal however. The water there is 10 degrees colder than next to Santa Cruz and you will freeze. Isabela is also a bit cool, but doable. Santa Cruz is best for diving.If you don't go diving, then snorkeling is great as well. Ask for the water temperature, it can vary enormously between islands! Or just go from Santa Cruz.

## Cuenca
- From Cuenca (or Vilcabamba), it seems to be easy to get to Peru (for instance Piura)

## Car Rental?

- it is possible to rent a car in quito and return it in Cuenca for instance. Alternatively, returning in Guayaquil or back in quito and then flying to lima (130-250 CHF, depending on how last minute) is also possible

## safety

It seems to be in general safer than colombia and mexico: https://www.statista.com/statistics/947781/homicide-rates-latin-america-caribbean-country/. Guayaquil and the north should be avoided, but maybe we can still check a few other places? https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ecuador-travel-advisory.html
