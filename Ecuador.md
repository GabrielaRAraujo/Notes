## ToDo's: 
- Cuenca volunteering?

## ToRead
- Gabriel García Márquez: cien anos de soledad o doze contos de peregrinos.
- Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada, Pablo Neruda

## Puerto Lopez
- we are taking the [diving course](https://www.maresecuador.com/diving-safaris) here

It is surrounded by the machalilla national park. It seems to be very safe, perfect for humpback whale watching from June to October and for diving (for instance taking a tour to isla de la plata)
- A few things to do:
    - [whale watching ecuador](https://www.voyagers.travel/blog/best-places-to-see-whales-ecuador)

## Galapagos 

### General
- 3 main islands 
- I would not stay longer than 10 above-water days on Galapagos, it got a little bit boring at the end I would say. 1 or 1.5 weeks is a good amount of time if you visit all 3 main islands imo. They are not too different so you could stay shorter and only visit 2 as well.
- Scuba diving: if you go scuba diving there you should do a course somewhere else before to already get some experience and save a lot of money. Scuba diving in Galapagos can be a bit tricky because of underwater currents at some locations (but not all!). It is really doable however. My girlfriend did her first scuba diving course there and enjoyed it a lot. You should not dive from San Cristobal however. The water there is 10 degrees colder than next to Santa Cruz and you will freeze. Isabela is also a bit cool, but doable. Santa Cruz is best for diving.If you don't go diving, then snorkeling is great as well. Ask for the water temperature, it can vary enormously between islands! Or just go from Santa Cruz.

### Program 
- **Galapagos giant tortoise**: They can be seen free in El chato ranch (4.6) and primicias ranch (4.7, good empanadas), for instance. 40$ for a taxi both ways, 45 min ride. 10$ fee p.p. includes lava tunnels. One can continue going inland to see the *los Gemelos* park

- **Snorkeling close by**:
	- **Tortuga bay** (45 min walk, ~22C) [water temp](https://www.surf-forecast.com/breaks/Tortuga-Bay-1/seatemp). Nike **hike**. Stop for checking/swimming on **Las Grietas** Bring stuff, because there is no service/structure around. One can also **kayak** there. Need to find out the best spot for snorkeling.
	- **El Garapatero**. East from Puerto Ayora, 40$ both ways by taxi. Peaceful, quite empty beach. Also for - **Kayaking** but no "Es recomendable no hacer snorkeling a partir de las 17h00 por la presencia de tiburones."

- **Isla plaza sur** looks very pretty, close to the coast of Santa cruz, also  on the east. Maybe do it with Garapatero?

- **Santa Fe island**: good for **snorkeling** and **diving** with sea lions

- **Isabela Island**: **snorkeling** at concha perla (sea lions, penguins, turtles). go to las tintoneras for marine iguanas. Galapagos penguins in many parts. Flamingo in flamingo lake. Hiking Vulcan. Day tour (inkl flamingo & tintoneras, 180$)[https://www.daytoursgalapagos.com/isabela-island]. Maybe worth for the price to stay one night? Ferry ~35$/p.p. 

- **Diving around Santa Cruz** [infos here](https://academybaydiving.com/diving-the-galapagos/galapagos-dive-sites/)
	- **Santa Fe**: easiest diving of all, but should still be very pretty. 
	- **North Seymour** Octopus?
	- **Floreana** Baby sea lions and usually recommended for sea lions
	- **Pinzon** dolphins?
	- **Guy Fawkes** playful sealions
 


- **Beim schlechtem Wetter**:
	- Darwin Station
	-

## Cuenca
- From Cuenca (or Vilcabamba), it seems to be easy to get to Peru (for instance Piura)
- vegane encebollado essen

## Varia

### Our favorite food in Ecuador

- Verde and everything with it: empanada de verde, bolon de verde, patacones. Tigrillo was ok, but Bolon is better
- Green mango with salt
- Fruits and juices: banana with passion fruit, pina with coconut
- tonga (rice, vegetables, peanut butter)
- Club beer
- Pan de almidón. Tipo um polvilho

### Car Rental?

- it is possible to rent a car in quito and return it in Cuenca for instance. Alternatively, returning in Guayaquil or back in quito and then flying to lima (130-250 CHF, depending on how last minute) is also possible

### Safety

It seems to be in general safer than colombia and mexico: https://www.statista.com/statistics/947781/homicide-rates-latin-america-caribbean-country/. Guayaquil and the north should be avoided, but maybe we can still check a few other places? https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ecuador-travel-advisory.html
Mindo and Puerto Lopez seemed overall safe to us.
