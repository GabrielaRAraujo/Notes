# Ecuador

## general plan 
Coast -> Guayaquil -> Galapagos -> Guayaquil -> south countryside (?)

## ToDo's: 
- Decide what to do between Quito Guayaquil
- Decide/check regarding scuba diving "license"
- Decide how long in Galapagos
- Buy Galapagos tickets
- Decide on spanish course & volunteering (maybe in Cuenca?) 
## safety

It seems to be in general safer than colombia and mexico: https://www.statista.com/statistics/947781/homicide-rates-latin-america-caribbean-country/. Guayaquil and the north should be avoided, but maybe we can still check a few other places? https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ecuador-travel-advisory.html

## Puerto Lopez

It is surrounded by the machalilla national park. It seems to be very safe, perfect for humpback whale watching from June to October and for diving (for instance taking a tour to isla de la plata)
- A few things to do:

- probably take the [diving course](https://www.maresecuador.com/diving-safaris) here

## Galapagos 

- 3 main islands 
- I would not stay longer than 10 above-water days on Galapagos, it got a little bit boring at the end I would say. 1 or 1.5 weeks is a good amount of time if you visit all 3 main islands imo. They are not too different so you could stay shorter and only visit 2 as well.
- Scuba diving: if you go scuba diving there you should do a course somewhere else before to already get some experience and save a lot of money. Scuba diving in Galapagos can be a bit tricky because of underwater currents at some locations (but not all!). It is really doable however. My girlfriend did her first scuba diving course there and enjoyed it a lot. You should not dive from San Cristobal however. The water there is 10 degrees colder than next to Santa Cruz and you will freeze. Isabela is also a bit cool, but doable. Santa Cruz is best for diving.If you don't go diving, then snorkeling is great as well. Ask for the water temperature, it can vary enormously between islands! Or just go from Santa Cruz.

- hiking. I did part of the Quilotoa loop and it was fantastic. I only hiked 2 days and I wish it had been more! On the way, definitely sleep over in Llullu Llama (https://llullullama.com/), that was one of the best places I have slept so far.
