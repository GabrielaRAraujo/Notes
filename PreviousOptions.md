# From costa rica:
- we have to think about which flights to book or rather start from mexiko, like cancun. But he problem of starting from there is that we would have to cross honduras or san salvador, which seem to be more dangerous than ecuador
- it is not the best time (best time is in between dec and april, October is the month it rains the most there) time around christmas break is the busiest there. 
- Spanish course expensive
- Direct flight from frankfurt to Cancun: 500 CHF
- Zurique Cancun: 490

# punta cana 
- (dominican republic): hurricane season from aug to late october.
- with swiss from Fra: 440

# starting from brazil
- it is hard to find a place where we both have to be in order to go back to washington and zurich. 
- we would miss Christmas / news eve. Prefer to be in a "safe place" just before starting working
- Zurich rio (14.10): 480 CHF
